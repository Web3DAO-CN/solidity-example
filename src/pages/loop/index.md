title: For and While Loop
version: 0.8.10
description: Example of for and while loop in Solidity
---

Solidity supports `for`, `while`, and `do while` loops.

Don't write loops that are unbounded as this can hit the gas limit, causing your transaction to fail.

For the reason above, `while` and `do while` loops are rarely used.

```solidity
{{{Loop}}}
```
