description: Example of how to use fallback in Solidity
---

`fallback` is a function that does not take any arguments and does not return anything.

It is executed either when

- a function that does not exist is called or
- Ether is sent directly to a contract but `receive()` does not exist or `msg.data` is not empty

`fallback` has a 2300 gas limit when called by `transfer` or `send`.

```solidity
{{{Fallback}}}
```
