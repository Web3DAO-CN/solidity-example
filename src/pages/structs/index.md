You can define your own type by creating a `struct`.

They are useful for grouping together related data.

Structs can be declared outside of a contract and imported in another contract.

```solidity
{{{Structs}}}
```

### Declaring and importing Struct

File that the struct is declared in

```solidity
{{{StructDeclaration}}}
```

File that imports the struct above

```solidity
{{{StructImport}}}
```
