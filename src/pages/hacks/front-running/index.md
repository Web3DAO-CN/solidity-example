description: An example of a Solidity contract vulnerable to front running

### Vulnerability

Transactions take some time before they are mined. An attacker can watch the transaction pool
and send a transaction, have it included in a block before the original transaction.
This mechanism can be abused to re-order transactions to the attacker's advantage.

```solidity

### Preventative Techniques

- use commit-reveal scheme
- use submarine send
